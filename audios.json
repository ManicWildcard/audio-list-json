      "notes": "You and your husband have been together for a very long time, and now you both feel secure enough to start trying for a baby. It’s been months now with no positive pregnancy test in sight, and you’re starting to get impatient. Your husband suggests a romantic vacation where the two of you will have nothing but time. He schedules it during your ovulation, but doesn’t realize that a combination of horny, desperate, and feral will end up with you jumping him naked in the hotel room. He’s not complaining… in fact, he’ll make sure you’re pregnant by the end of the night.",
